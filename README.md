reveal-cleaver-theme
================

[Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) theme for [cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver). Take the best of both worlds!

Small demo (sorry for image quality, will work on it) using [cleaver-template](https://github.com/sudodoki/cleaver-template)
![Sample usage](sample.gif)


How to run this?
================
Steps:  
1. `git clone https://github.com/sudodoki/reveal-cleaver-theme reveal` into your presentation folder
2. Set `theme: reveal` in your metadata.

If you are wondering 'Why is it not regular username/reponame that cleaver does support?' the answer is 'we are adding files that are not supported via this format'.
Resulting slideshow cannot be used without external resources (i.e. goole fonts, css/js/fonts in folder) - be aware of that.

Have any question/proposals?
============================
Don't hesitate to open issue, or just to do regular fork-feature branch-pull request thing on me.
